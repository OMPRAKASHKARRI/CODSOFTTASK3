# PROJECT 
PASSWORD GENERATOR

# Objective of the project
A password generator is a useful tool that generates strong and
random passwords for users. This project aims to create a
password generator application using Python, allowing users to
specify the length and complexity of the password.
User Input: Prompt the user to specify the desired length of thepassword.
Generate Password: Use a combination of random characters to
generate a password o
f the specified length.
Display the Password: Print the generated password on the screen.

# key objectives:
Secure Password Generation: To generate strong and secure passwords that include a combination of different character types and are of sufficient length to enhance security.

User Data Management: To store and manage user-generated passwords securely in a database, allowing for future retrieval and ensuring that passwords are not easily lost or forgotten.

Ease of Use: To provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to generate and store passwords without requiring technical expertise.

Input Validation and Error Handling: To ensure that users provide valid inputs and to handle errors gracefully, providing feedback to users to correct their input.

Scalability and Persistence: To build a system that can handle multiple users and store their passwords persistently in a database.

# key insights:
User-Friendly Interface: The script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to generate and store passwords, making the application accessible to non-technical users.

Input Validation: The code includes validation checks to ensure that the inputs provided by the user (username and password length) are appropriate. This prevents errors and ensures the quality of the generated password.

Password Generation: The script generates strong passwords by including a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. The length of the password is customizable by the user, allowing for flexibility in password strength requirements.

Data Persistence: The application uses a SQLite database to store generated passwords along with their corresponding usernames. This ensures that the passwords can be retrieved or checked against later, providing a persistent storage solution.

Error Handling and Messaging: The script includes error handling and informative messages for the user, ensuring a smooth user experience by guiding them through correct input and operation steps.

# Technologies:
Python: The primary programming language used to develop the application, providing various libraries and modules for GUI creation, database management, and more.

Tkinter: A standard Python library used for creating the graphical user interface. Tkinter provides the tools to build windows, labels, buttons, and other UI elements.

SQLite: A lightweight, file-based database management system used to store user data (usernames and generated passwords). SQLite is used here due to its simplicity and ease of integration with Python.

Random Module: Used for generating random characters for the password, ensuring a high level of randomness and security in the generated passwords.

String Module: Provides a collection of string constants (like ASCII letters, digits, etc.) used in the password generation process.
